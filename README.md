This repository is detined for the puzzlebot robot with a camera and a LiDAR sensor mounted. The main objective of this project is navigate through a series of points defined and estimate position based on the dynamic model and Kalman Filter correction using defined Arucos at specific positions in the world. 

**Launch instructions to launch in separated terminals:**

To launch the challenge world. *This launch includes the odometry estimation with Kalman Filter and publish the frame of the real robot in gazebo*
```
$ roslaunch bloque navigation_world.launch 
```

To launch the aruco deection node.
```
$ rosrun aruco_detect aruco_detect /camera/compressed:=/camera/image_raw/compressed /camera_info:=/camera/camera_info
```

To launch the navigation node.
```
$ rosrun bloque navigation.py
```
